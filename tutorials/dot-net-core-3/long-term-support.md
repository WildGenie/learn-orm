# Long-term Support

.NET Core 3.1 is an LTS release with support from Microsoft for the next three years. It's highly recommended that you move your apps to .NET Core 3.1. 

 - Every Microsoft product has a lifecycle. 
 - The lifecycle begins when a product is released and ends when it's no longer supported. 
 - Knowing key dates in this lifecycle helps you make informed decisions about when to upgrade or make other changes to your software.

Customers can choose Long Term Support (LTS) releases or Current releases. LTS releases will receive only critical and compatible fixes throughout their lifecycle. Current releases will receive these same fixes and will also be updated with compatible innovations and features.
