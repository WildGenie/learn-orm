Microsoft's .NET 5 is the next step forward with .NET Core. It has some major changes that can significantly impact your organization.

The .NET 5 project aims to improve .NET in a few key ways.

 - A single .NET 5 native application project would support targets such as Windows, Microsoft Duo (Android), and Apple iOS using native controls on those platforms.
 - It expands the capabilities of .NET by taking the best of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and Mono.
 - It also builds a product from a single code-base that Microsoft, as well as community developers, can work together and that improves all scenarios.

The .NET 5 is the future of .NET Core and is almost a complete reimagining of the old .NET Framework. 

 - So far both .NET Core and .NET Framework were maintained in parallel, and you were able to choose between the two.

 - It is a game-changer project for .NET, all your code and project files will look and feel the same no matter which type of app you are building With .NET 5. 
 - You will have access to the same runtime, API, and language capabilities with each app.
