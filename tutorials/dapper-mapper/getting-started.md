# Getting Started

**Dapper.Mapper** is a small NuGet library that extends and simplifies the multi mapping functionality of Dapper. 

 - It allows you to map a single row to multiple objects. 
 - It also automatically figures out the relationships between the returned objects and assigns them.

## Installation

To start using the **Dapper.Mapper** in your application. You will need to install the [Dapper.Mapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper.Mapper) NuGet package.
