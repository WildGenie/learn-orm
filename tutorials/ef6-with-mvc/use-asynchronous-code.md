# Use Asynchronous Code

So far we have used the synchronous programming model to read, write and update data. In this article, we will see how to implement the asynchronous programming model. 

## Why Asynchronous Programming?

A web server has a limited number of threads available, and in high load situations, all of the available threads might be in use. When that happens, the server can't process new requests until the threads are freed up. 

 - With synchronous code, many threads may be tied up while they aren't doing any work because they're waiting for I/O to complete. 
 - With asynchronous code, when a process is waiting for I/O to complete, its thread is freed up for the server to use for processing other requests. 
 - As a result, the asynchronous code enables server resources to be used more efficiently, and the server is enabled to handle more traffic without delays.

## Benefits

 - In earlier versions of .NET, writing and testing asynchronous code was complex, error-prone, and hard to debug. 
 - In .NET 4.5, writing, testing, and debugging asynchronous code is so much easier than you should generally write asynchronous code unless you have a reason not to. 
 - Asynchronous code does introduce a small amount of overhead, but for low traffic situations, the performance hit is negligible. 
For high traffic situations, potential performance improvement is substantial.
 - Asynchronous code can help an application perform better because it makes better use of server resources.

## Create Book Controller

Let's create a `BookController` the same way we created an `AuthorController`, except this time we will select the **Use async controller actions** check box.

If you open the `BookController` and look at the `Index` action, you will see some changes as compared to synchronous code.

```csharp
public async Task<ActionResult> Index()
{
    var books = db.Books.Include(b => b.Author);
    return View(await books.ToListAsync());
}
```

 - The `async` keyword tells the compiler to generate callbacks for parts of the method body and to automatically create the `Task<ActionResult>` object that is returned.
 - The return type was changed from `ActionResult` to `Task<ActionResult>`. The `Task<T>` type represents ongoing work with a result of type `T`.
 - The `await` keyword was applied to the web service call, when the compiler sees this keyword, behind the scenes it splits the method into two parts. 
   - The first part ends with the operation that is started asynchronously. 
   - The second part is put into a callback method that is called when the operation completes.
 - The asynchronous version of the ToList extension method was called.

### ToListAsync

In `Index` method, you can see that `books.ToList` statement modified but not the `var books = db.Books` statement. 

 - It is because that only statements that cause queries or commands to be sent to the database are executed asynchronously. 
 - The `var books = db.Books` statement sets up a query but the query is not executed until the `ToList` method is called. 
 - Therefore, only the `ToList` method is executed asynchronously.

### FindAsync

In the `Details` method and the `HttpGet` `Edit` and `Delete` methods, the `Find` method causes a query to be sent to the database, so that's the method that gets executed asynchronously.

```csharp
public async Task<ActionResult> Delete(int? id)
{
    if (id == null)
    {
        return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
    }
    Book book = await db.Books.FindAsync(id);
    if (book == null)
    {
        return HttpNotFound();
    }
    return View(book);
}
```

### SaveChangesAsync

In the `Create`, `HttpPost` `Edit`, and `DeleteConfirmed` methods, it is the `SaveChanges` method call that causes a command to be executed, not statements such as `db.Books.Add(book)` which only cause entities in memory to be modified.

```csharp
public async Task<ActionResult> Create([Bind(Include = "BookId,Title,AuthorId")] Book book)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        db.Books.Add(book);
        await db.SaveChangesAsync();
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }

    ViewBag.AuthorId = new SelectList(db.Authors, "AuthorId", "FirstName", book.AuthorId);
    return View(book);
}
```

### Update Views

Let's replace the following code in ***Views\Book\Index.cshtml*** file by changing the title to **Books**, moves the **Author** name to the right, and provides the full name of the author.

```csharp
@model IEnumerable<MvcWithEF6Demo.Models.Book>

@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Books";
}

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>
    @Html.ActionLink("Create New", "Create")
</p>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>
            @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Title)
        </th>
        <th>
            Author
        </th>
        <th></th>
    </tr>

@foreach (var item in Model) {
    <tr>
        <td>
            @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Title)
        </td>
        <td>
            @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Author.FullName)
        </td>
        <td>
            @Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id = item.BookId }) |
            @Html.ActionLink("Details", "Details", new { id = item.BookId }) |
            @Html.ActionLink("Delete", "Delete", new { id = item.BookId })
        </td>
    </tr>
}

</table>
```

In the `Create`, `Delete`, `Details`, and `Edit` views, we need to change the caption for the **AuthorId** field to **Author**.

In `Create` and `Edit` views you will see the caption line as shown below.

```csharp
@Html.LabelFor(model => model.AuthorId, "AuthorId", htmlAttributes: new { @class = "control-label col-md-2" })
```

Replace the above line with the following line.

```csharp
<label class="control-label col-md-2" for="AuthorId">Author</label>
```

Now let's update the `Details` view by using the author FullName instead of FirstName and also move the full name field below book title as shown below.

```csharp
@model MvcWithEF6Demo.Models.Book

@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Details";
}

<h2>Details</h2>

<div>
    <h4>Book</h4>
    <hr />
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>
            @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Title)
        </dt>

        <dd>
            @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.Title)
        </dd>
        <dt>
            @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Author.FullName)
        </dt>

        <dd>
            @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.Author.FullName)
        </dd>
    </dl>
</div>
<p>
    @Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id = Model.BookId }) |
    @Html.ActionLink("Back to List", "Index")
</p>

```

Repeat the same changes in `Delete` view as well.

```csharp
@model MvcWithEF6Demo.Models.Book

@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Delete";
}

<h2>Delete</h2>

<h3>Are you sure you want to delete this?</h3>
<div>
    <h4>Book</h4>
    <hr />
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>
            @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Title)
        </dt>

        <dd>
            @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.Title)
        </dd>
        <dt>
            @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Author.FullName)
        </dt>

        <dd>
            @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.Author.FullName)
        </dd>
    </dl>

    @using (Html.BeginForm()) {
        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()

        <div class="form-actions no-color">
            <input type="submit" value="Delete" class="btn btn-default" /> |
            @Html.ActionLink("Back to List", "Index")
        </div>
    }
</div>
```

Now run your application and click on **Books** tab.
