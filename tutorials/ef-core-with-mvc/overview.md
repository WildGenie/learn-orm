# Overview

## What is MVC?

MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. MVC separates the application into three components 

 - **Model:** Responsible for maintaining application data and business logic.
 - **View:** User interface of the application, which displays the data.
 - **Controller:** Handles users requests and renders appropriate View with Model data.

The MVC design pattern has been around for a few decades, and it's been used across many different technologies. 

### What is ASP.NET Core MVC?

The ASP.NET Core MVC framework is a lightweight, open source, highly testable presentation framework optimized for use with ASP.NET Core.

 - It provides a patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns. 
 - It gives you full control over markup, supports TDD-friendly development and uses the latest web standards.

### Features

 - **Routing:** A powerful URL-mapping component that lets you build applications that have comprehensible and searchable URLs.
 - **Model binding:** Converts client request data into objects that the controller can handle. 
 - **Model validation:** Supports validation by decorating your model object with data annotation validation attributes. 
 - **Dependency Injection (DI):** Built-in support for dependency injection, controllers can request needed services through their constructors, allowing them to follow the Explicit Dependencies Principle.
 - **Filters:** Encapsulate cross-cutting concerns, like exception handling or authorization.
 - **Areas:** Provide a way to partition a large ASP.NET Core MVC Web app into smaller functional groupings.
 - **Web APIs:** Support for building Web APIs, and you can build services that reach a broad range of clients including browsers and mobile devices.
 - **Testability:** The framework's use of interfaces and dependency injection make it well-suited to unit testing.
 - **Razor view engine:** Razor is a compact, expressive and fluid template markup language for defining views using embedded C# code.
 - **Strongly typed views:** Razor views in MVC can be strongly typed based on your model.
 - **Tag Helpers:** Enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. 
 - **View Components:** The `SetCompatibilityVersion` method allows an app to opt in or opt out of potentially breaking behavior changes introduced in ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1 or later.

## What is Entity Framework Core?

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

 - EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. 
 - It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code developers usually need to write.
 - It is intended to be used with .NET Core applications, but, it can also be used with standard .NET 4.5+ framework based applications.
