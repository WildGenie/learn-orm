# Overview

## What is Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

 - It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).
 - It combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. 
 - It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.
 - Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. 
 - You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [Visual Studio Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). 

## History

Visual Studio Code was announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A Preview build was released shortly thereafter.

 - On November 18, 2015, Visual Studio Code was released under the Expat License, and its source code was posted to GitHub. 
 - Extension support was also announced.
 - On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated the public preview stage and was released to the Web.

## Features

### Code Editor
 
 - Visual Studio Code is a code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including C#, Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, and C++. 
 - It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. 
 - It employs codenamed ***Monaco*** the same editor component which is used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services).

### Language Support

 - Instead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more directories, which can then be saved in workspaces for future reuse. 
 - This allows it to operate as a language-agnostic code editor for any language. 
 - It supports many programming languages and a set of features that differs per language. 

### Extensions

 - Visual Studio Code can be extended via extensions that are available through a central repository. 
 - This includes additions to the editor and language support.
 - A notable feature is the ability to create extensions that add support for new languages, themes, and debuggers, perform static code analysis, and add code linters using the Language Server Protocol.
 - Visual Studio Code includes multiple extensions for FTP, allowing the software to be used as a free alternative for web development. 
 - Code can be synced between the editor and the server, without downloading any extra software.

### Others

 - Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from the project tree via the settings. 
 - Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface but can be accessed via the command palette.
 - Visual Studio Code allows users to set the code page in which the active document is saved, the newline character, and the programming language of the active document. 
 - This allows it to be used on any platform, in any locale, and for any given programming language.
