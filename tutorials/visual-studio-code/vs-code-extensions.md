# VS Code Extensions

The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code. This topic explains how to find, install, and manage VS Code extensions from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

## Install Extensions

You can browse and install extensions from within Visual Studio Code. To open the **Extensions** view, click on the **Extensions** icon in the **Activity Bar** on the Visual Studio Code side.

It will show you a list of the most popular Visual Studio Code extensions on the **VS Code Marketplace**.

 - Each extension in the list includes a brief description, the publisher, the download count, and a five-star rating. 
 - You can click on the extension item to display the extension's details page, where you can learn more.

To install an extension, click on the **Install** button.

On the **Feature Contributions** page, you can see the extension's additions to VS Code such as settings, commands, and keyboard shortcuts, language grammars, debugger, etc.

If an extension is an Extension Pack, the **Extension Pack** section will display which extensions will be installed when you install the pack. Extension Packs bundle separate extensions together so they can be easily installed at one time.

You can sort the extension list by **Install Count**, **Rating**, **Name**, or **Publised Date**.
