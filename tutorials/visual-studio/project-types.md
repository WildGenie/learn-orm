# Project Types

Visual Studio includes several project types for languages such as Visual C# and Visual Basic. Visual Studio also lets you create your own project types.

You can create various types of projects using Visual Studio predefined templates depending on your requirements. When you first open Visual Studio, the start window appears, and from there, you can choose **Create a new project**.

On the **Create a new project** page, a list of your recently selected templates appears on the left. If you're not selecting from the recently used templates, you can filter all available project templates by Language, Platform, and Project type.
