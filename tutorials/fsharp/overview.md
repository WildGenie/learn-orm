# Overview

## What is F#?

F# is a functional-first, general-purpose, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. 

 - It is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language on .NET Core. 
 - It can also generate JavaScript and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.

## Why F#?

F# was initially available only on Windows as a Microsoft Research project, but it is now a first-class language on several platforms. 

 - You can use F# on Windows, Mac, and Linux with tool support in Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio, MonoDevelop, Emacs, and on Android and iOS devices and the Web using HTML5. 
 - In addition to general-purpose programming, F# applies to GPU code, big data, games, and much more.
 - F# can be used as a scripting language as well as a programming language.
 - Unlike JavaScript, Ruby, and Python, F# is strongly typed, not dynamically typed. Unlike C and C++, which are also strongly typed, but require all types to be declared, F# performs type inference whenever possible.

## History

F# is developed by the F# Software Foundation, Microsoft, and open contributors. The open-source, cross-platform compiler for F# is available from the F# Software Foundation. 

The language has gone through several versions.
