# Add Entity Framework Core Functionality

Entity Framework is a lightweight ORM and simplifies mappings between your .NET objects and the tables and columns in your relational database. 

It is widely used and well known for the following features.

 - Rich mapping capabilities and has support for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
 - Support for inheritance, complex types as well as stored procedures.
 - A possibility of using only code, the so-called “Code-First” approach (including setting up the database and interacting with tables and columns only through code).
 - It offers a visual designer for creating entity models.
 - It offers excellent integration with ASP.NET Framework.
 - Support for eager, lazy, and explicit loading.
 
## Install EF Core

To install EF Core, open the terminal and go to the project folder and run the following commands.

```csharp
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
```

We are ready to start writing some Entity Framework code.

## Create a Model

The model plays a significant part in the Entity Framework. It contains configurations, mapping properties, relationships, and defines which objects map to which tables. Let’s open the Visual Code and open the project folder in it.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/learn-orm/master/tutorials/entity-framework-core-on-ubuntu/images/add-ef-core-2.png">

Let’s add a new class **Customer** to the **Models** folder.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace MVCWithEFCore.Models
{
    public class Customer
    {
        public int CustomerID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public Boolean IsActive { get; set; }
        public List<PhoneContact> PhoneContacts { get; set; }
        public Customer()
        {
            PhoneContacts = new List<PhoneContact>();
        }
    }
}
```

Now add another class in the **Models** and call it **PhoneContact**. 

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace MVCWithEFCore.Models
{
    public class PhoneContact
    {
        public int PhoneContactID { get; set; }
        public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
        public int CustomerID { get; set; }
        public Customer Customer { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## Define the DbContext

If you have used Entity Framework before, you will know how to define a **DbContext** and the underlying **Models** that define a database schema. We have already created a simple model that has **Customer** and **PhoneContact** classes, now let’s ensure that these classes are part of the **DbContext** by defining a new context called **EntityContext**.

So first we will create a new folder called **Data** and add an **EntityContext** class in that folder.   

```csharp
using Microsoft.Data.Sqlite;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using MVCWithEFCore.Models;
using System;

namespace MVCWithEFCore.Data
{
    public class EntityContext : DbContext
    {
        public static string DbPath = "DbMy.db";

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=" + DbPath);
        }
		
        public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
        public DbSet<PhoneContact> PhoneContacts { get; set; }
    }
}
```

In ASP.NET Core, services such as the DB context must be registered with the dependency injection (DI) container. The container provides the service to controllers, so we need to update **ConfigureServices** in **Startup.cs** file with the following code.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddDbContext<EntityContext>(options => options.UseSqlite("Data Source="+ EntityContext.DbPath));
}
```
