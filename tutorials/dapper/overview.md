# Overview

Dapper is an open-source, lightweight ORM developed by the Stack Overflow team. It is a simple object mapper for the Microsoft .NET platform. 

 - It is a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.
 - It is free as open-source software that is distributed under a dual license, either the Apache License 2.0 or the MIT License.

## What is ORM

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational databases and object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc.

Object-relational mappers (ORMs) have been in use for a long time to eliminate the impedance mismatch that exists between the object models of programming languages and the data models in relational databases.

## Why Dapper?

Dapper is very lightweight and because of its weight, it is very fast as compared to other ORMs.

 - The performance and its ease of use were the main reasons which were kept in mind during its development. 
 - It provides support for both static and dynamic object binding using transactions, stored procedures, or bulk inserts of data.
 - It is not database specific, it works across all .NET ADO providers such as SQL Server, SQLite, Firebird, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL. 

## Features

The following are the key features of Dapper.

 - High performance
 - Fewer lines of code
 - Object mapper
 - Choice of static/dynamic object binding
 - Easy handling of SQL query
